# Detection-of-Communities-in-Social-Network-Graphs

The aim of this project is to detect communities in social network graphs, through clustering techniques. Hierarchical clustering techniques should be implemented,
and the "Optimal" graph division into communities (given the hierarchical clustering chosen), based on modularity.

We will also experiment with the algorithms we implemented, in a real social network snapshot. The aim is to compare different community tracking techniques, both
in terms of execution speed as well as in terms of the quality of the provided partitions of its peaks chart in non-overlapping communities.
